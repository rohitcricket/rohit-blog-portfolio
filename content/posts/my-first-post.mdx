title: What You Need to Know About how Amazon Builds Software

Have you heard of the Amazon Builders' Library? I am assuming you have not because until 
re:invent 2019, I hadn't heard either. 

### What is the Amazon Builders' Library?
It is a collection of articles that describe how Amazon develops and operates software. 
The content is written by Amazon’s senior technical leaders and engineers. As of December 2019, 
there are only 13 articles, but more content is expected in the future. 

### Why should you read the Builders’ Library?
If you wonder how AWS automates software delivery to achieve over 150 million deployments a year, 
then you should read the Builders' library. You may have other questions:  
- How Amazon's engineer engineers implement principles such as shuffle sharding to build resilient 
systems that are highly available and fault tolerant?
- How AWS handles the complicated development and operations issues arising from distributed systems?
- How to use static stability to achieve high resilience?
And you may have many more questions.

### What I learned about Distributed Systems
I learned about offline distributed systems, soft real-time distributed systems and hard real-time 
distributed systems

Offline distributed systems include batch processing systems, big data analysis clusters, movie scene rendering farms, 
protein folding clusters, etc. 

Soft real-time distributed systems include search index builders, systems that look for 
impaired servers, roles for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), etc. A search indexer might be offline for 
(depending on the application) from 10 minutes to many hours without undue customer impact. Roles for Amazon EC2 
must push updated credentials to (essentially) every EC2 instance, but it has hours in which to do so because the 
old credentials don’t expire for some time.

Hard real-time distributed systems include front-end web servers, the order pipeline, credit card transactions, 
every AWS API, telephony, etc. They are the hardest to implement.
